               <h2>Crocheting</h2>
               <p>In December of 2022 I decided to take on a new hobby in the form of crocheting. I started simple by trying to learn a few basic stitches and my first finsihed project was a beanie. My first project took me about a week to complete, but with more practice I started getting a lot faster. Since then, I have made coasters, hats, blankets, and even small stuffed animals. Making stuffed animals is a style of crochet called amigurumi and required lots of patience and practice. This has easily become of my favorite hobbies and I might even open my own Etsy shop one day!</p>

               <h2>Reading</h2>
               <p>Throughout my life I have always loved to read, but have often found myself feeling that I don't have enough time to read. This year, I have made sure I have plenty of time to read whether it is an audiobook during my commute or laying in bed on my kindle. Since January I have read 24 books this year and hope to read at least 10 more before the end of the year. My go to genre is fantasy and I love the getting to see the fictional worlds come to life throughout the story. My general motto when picking a book is that it has to have a map, those are typically the best thought out and epic fantasy books.</p>

               <h2>Painting</h2>
               <p>During COVID, I found myself feeling bored of watching TV and playing on my phone all the time. Since I was at home all the time I decided to try painting to bring out my creative side. I started off by buying a few canvases and some basic paint and brushes. I quickly realized that this was a great form of relaxation kept me busy for hours at a time. While I am no Picasso, I felt like I was getting pretty good at painting landscapes and even painted some canvases as gifts for my family. While I don't paint as much as I used to, I still pick up the occasional Paint by Numbers kits from the craft store and still love the feeling of putting a brush to canvas.</p>

                  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I would love to start baking desserts and pastries at some point. I have always been interested in the art of cake decorating but for now I think I will stick to making brownies for my family.</p>
